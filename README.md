# Detection of Hate Speech in Telegram
# Description
Hate speech on social media platforms like Telegram presents a significant challenge, 
threatening user safety and the platform's reputation. Telegram users send millions of 
messages daily, making it impossible for human moderators to review all content manually. 
The sheer volume and speed of content generation necessitate a more efficient solution for 
detecting and mitigating hate speech. Successfully managing hate speech can create a safer
environment for users, fostering positive interactions and reducing harm.
